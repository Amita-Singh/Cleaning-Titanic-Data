# Cleaning-Titanic-Data
 ##About the data
 One of the most popular starter data sets in data science, the Titanic data set. This is a data set that records various attributes of passengers on the Titanic, including who survived and who didnâ€™t. 
 
 ##What did I do
 Here I have detected some missing value, replace the missing values and also create new values added to the dataset.

 ##The output
 There are two csv files, first one is titanic_original.csv and second one is tatanic_clean.csv. Second csv is generated from the R code, called 'titanic.r' here. Have fun.
